                            <p>It seems that just about every day someone posts asking about various games being made available through backwards compatibility. OG Xbox titles in particular are a hot topic, likely due to the relatively small number currently available. Rather than offer another opinion, I thought I'd make a post of all the possible games, and a little context about the current status of a small handful of them. This list consists of just under half of all games released on the original Xbox. If a game doesn't. Have a few DS/3DS and Vita games for sale, as well as a rather large original Xbox collection, including a CIB green button Steel Battalion, the authentic scope for silent scope, and a never used Green Halo system. I have a bunch of trades here on /r/gamesale and over on /r/hardwareswap, feel free to check my post history or whatever. Thanks! Any questions just ask.

NES : Conflict - A strategy game which alternates between two modes of play: a strategic/operational scale, in which players move their units around the hex map; and a tactical combat module for resolving unit-to-unit combats and include a choice of either issuing orders themselves or using the "auto" mode which delegates command to the AI. By capturing towns and winning battles, the player gains "fame" points that can be used to purchase more and better military hardware. Every scenario.

Bombastic (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i7iai7NuXME) - A puzzle game where the player has to attempt to clear a field of explosive dice. To set the dice off, the player must roll the top face of the die they're standing on next to the same number of interconnected die with the same face (i.e. connect five 5's, four 4's). After a set period of time, the dice will explode, igniting any dice that the explosion touches that either match the number, or are one lower. This game is very fast-paced. AirForce Delta Storm (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HO-rVu-ymCY) - A flight combat simulator that lets the player choose from over 40 modern warplanes. THe player is given a mission to destroy one or more air or ground targets, and if these missions are accomplished, the player earns money which can be used to buy more planes. However, if a mission is failed, then the player loses the plane they were flying in (except the A-7 Corsair II that was started with) and must then buy a new plane.

Is there a way to play Pitfall: The Lost Expedition on the PC? I remember playing it on the wii and I feel like I need to play this game again. thx in advance. It seems like this IP has just dropped off the face of the earth ever since Pitfall: The Lost Expedition, (which was a HUGELY underrated gem and most of my childhood) an awesome action platformer game that was decently long, had good reviews, but ever since then it seems like all we've ever gotten in form of "new games" is just remakes of the first game on Atari Remakes. Anyone have any news or would want another Pitfall game like Pitfall: The Lost Expedition. I was curious about what the least played GameCube games were and I figured I'd get a good enough idea by using the widely-used website GameFAQs, which lists GameCube games along with votes submitted by users for rating purposes. I'm not listing games not released in North America, and thought that listing games with less than 50 votes would be appropriate enough. For comparison, here are the 10 games with the most votes: Super Smash Bros. Melee - 7624 The Legend of Zelda: The Wind Waker </p>

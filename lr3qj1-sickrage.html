                            <p> Not sure if Medusa has it's own subreddit. Couldn't find one, so I'm posting here. Feel free to delete. I'm trying to migrate from Sickrage running natively to Medusa running in Docker. Because of this, I decided to just set Medusa up from scratch, rather export and import settings. The only problem I am having is adding shows. I add an "existing show", pick the folder, let it pull down metadata and then chose "recheck files." After it's done that, it shows all the files are "archived," 
i didn't think I would love it this much, but holy shit Manual Search is amazing!!! ~~I only wish I could select x/h265, HEVC in preferred quality, but this isn't part of sickrage either.~~ So far, very happy with Medusa. EDIT It appears I was incorrect about x265 in Medusa. It was in a place I didn't think to look. In Medusa, there is not only a required words, but they added a Preferred words option Gear gt Search Settings gt Preferred words gt Add "x265, h265" Thanks to /u/do. Hey. You guys know any program similar to Sickrage (auto download TV shows) but written in Go? amp#x200B; Thanks. So with all the chaos of name changing, upgrading my install etc. I decided to try out sonarr and here are some thoughts I was hoping everyone can contribute to. Sickchill Benefits include all in one packaging, no need to install Jackett for searching private torrent providers, will extract packages on its own (vs. Sonarr relies on rutorrent to extract rar files). Sonarr benefits: development environment seems less chaotic, search functionality for new and backlog filling seems better- Hi, I have an issue with sickrage downloading new episodes, nothing has changed from my side. can you help resolve this please? "Local branch is ahead of master. Automatic update not possible." 2019-03-22 11:26:32 SEARCHQUEUE-MANUAL-266189 :: IPTorrents :: 61a763d Request failed: Error parsing Cloudflare IUAM Javascript challenge.

From my understanding, Medusa is a fork of Sickrage correct? Or a fork of something else, but regardless. I highly assume both are not the same (anymore). Though the tutorials on the github are a mess: https://github.com/pymedusa/Medusa/wiki/Installation-amp-Configuration-Guides (https://github.com/pymedusa/Medusa/wiki/Installation-amp-Configuration-Guides) Install Medusa on Ubuntu in a few simple steps --gt (http://www.htpcbeg. Need help sorting / renaming movies. I just want it to rename the movie to the original file name that has the quality etc.ive tried %dn and %fn. Still renames it to just a bunch of numbers and letters. Any idea what it should. I'm having some trouble with search providers. The only torrent one that works is The Pirate Bay; I would like to add 1337x.to, however I am unable to. Does anyone know how to? Also, some artist's albums do not how up in the database, but when I check the last.fm website they are posted. Any help there. So I had not even been aware of the drama of this sickrage/sickchill thing and just finally got moved over. I came from a fully updated sickrage setup over to a newly minted git clone of sickchill. I moved over the config file and database, finessed the former and also reconfigured my systemd script. It looks like things are functional via the interface so far, but I did notice none of the posters/artwork is there which leads me to the question today. As someone that just came from sickrag. Hello everyone, I've been using Windows for some time on my HTPC/Home Server PC. However, I've always wanted to be able to access the computer remotely to perform tasks related to the home server (move/copy file, transcode videos, look at SickRage/Utorrent status, fix MP3 tags, etc.) while not disturbing kodi playback on the screen. As you may know, it is not possible to have concurrent sessions in Windows out of the box. I've tried an RDP hack for some time, but it was a little buggy, nothing. So I've been using Sickrage for years. Still works without any issues. I have no idea what Sickchill is. The only reason I found this sub is because I was trying to figure out why Sickrage stopped updating and displays the message " Local branch is ahead of master. Automatic update not possible." Should I be doing something about that or am I good? Edit: I use FeralHosting. Hey  why is my local sickrage. (a) displaying a login screen when the config for user/pwd is nil? (b) redirecting me to the sickrage.ca (https://sickrage.ca) login. Hi Get back from vacation and learn that someone is having a temper tantrum. My Sickrage will no longer launch. Tried updating and now it asks me for a login fro Sickrage.ca (https://Sickreage.ca). Searches point me here to learn that I need to use SickChill from now on. I don't use the backup feature in Sickrage because I use the backup in Unraid. Installed the SickChill docker and tried copying over the Config.ini only to get an error that I am not authorized. I tried copying 
I was wondering what the consensus was. amp#x200B; I've been using Sickrage for a few years now, it ain't perfect but it got the job done, mostly. It recently blew up on me so I've been trialling Sonarr for a few days. It gets more backlogged episodes, which is really great, but it seems to barf on some shows that Sickrage handled, eg Real Time With Bill Maher. The most important thing to me though is that Sonarr doesn't seem able to add new shows that haven't been broadcast yet. Sickrage. Hi all, I have a qnap ts-221 and would like to install sickrage, however i can not seem to install it. Tried the tutorial on tweaking4all.com (https://tweaking4all.com) but cannot install the qpkg on my qnap. Is there anybody here willing to help me with a correct tutorial ? amp#x200B; Thanks. Basically what the Title says. VERY happy with my Medusa installation and implementation. Its running pretty smoothly and has really filled some of the gaps i had from running sickrage before. I would like to do the same processing of my Movies folder but I feel Medusa might not be the best fit for that. Does anyone use Medusa for Movies, or use another program I'm still getting the "local branch is ahead of master. Automatic update not possible." error after following these (https://github.com/SickChill/SickChill/issues/5022) instructions. I've edited the config file in "\SickRage\Data" with sickrage off, and then restarted, but still getting the error. Am I just a massive idiot and messing something up myself HI Team, Having some issues installing sick rage on the freenas, never had this happen before, update is failing. ERROR We can't proceed with the update. Unable to check remote DB version. Error: AssertionError('Empty response from r/ Is it me or the servers. Hi, I have finally decided to invest in a seedbox so have picked seedbox.co, I decided to pay for a month and im trying to setup sickrage or the like. I believe that i have to install it on to ubuntu i have followed some guides and i have just ran into issues, i wont lie linux and commands are beyond me but i can follow a guide. I was hoping someone here may be able to help me. i think the issue i have is that the guides are out of date i followed some from HTPC guides. Any help of advice. 
I feel like it would be useful as hell, just to make sure it's a complete collection. Just found out about Medusa, and i want to try it out. I have installed the windows version but how do i config it? the setup guide talks about SickRage, i dont see any config guide for Medusa any help would be appreciated. I'd like to switch from Sickrage on my ReadyNAS with x386 OS 4 to Sickchill the problem is I don't know how to do that. Anyone who has a tutorial how to do that? A .bin that is compatibel with my ReadyNAS x386 OS 4 would be great too! Thanks </p>
